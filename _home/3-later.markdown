title: "Some time later"

During my misguided tour of software engineering, a group of friends of mine started a political satire show. Due to my background, I became the show’s Swiss Army Knife.  I was the show’s graphic designer, editor, producer, special effect artist, and full-stack developer (poverty truly breeds ingenuity).

 It wasn’t really successful  but we had the opportunity to meet several political figures from Puerto Rico. That’s when I was offered a job as a web developer for a political candidate. They realized something that I hadn’t by then, which is that knowing both graphic design and how to code was a powerful combination. And at the price I was offering that combination due to my own imposter syndrome feels, they had struck gold.
 
 After the campaign was over I continued working as a freelance frontend developer building custom Wordpress themes. While working freelance I finished my bachelor’s in graphic design with a final project that would push my web development skills over and above just client-side development.
