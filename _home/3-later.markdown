During my misguided tour in computer engineering, a group of friends of mine started a political satire show. Due to my background, I became the show’s <a tabindex="0" data-content="Poverty truly breeds ingenuity.">Swiss Army Knife\*</a>. I was the show’s graphic designer, editor, special effect artist, and web developer.

It wasn’t really successful but we had the opportunity to meet several political figures from Puerto Rico. That’s when I was offered a job as a web developer for a political candidate. They realized something that I hadn’t by then, which is that knowing both graphic design and how to code was a <a tabindex="0" data-content="And at the price I was offering that combination due to my own imposter syndrome feels, they had struck gold.">powerful combination\*</a>.

After the campaign was over I continued working as a freelance front-end developer building custom Wordpress themes and static web pages, front-end stuff. While working freelance I finished my bachelor’s in graphic design with a final project that would push my web development skills beyond just client-side development.
