title: Beyond the Front-End of the <a tabindex="0" data-content="And what I found there.">Web</a>
---
For my final project I decided to make an interactive web-comic. In my web-comic, the reader/user would become my co-author. Yet, I needed a way for the users to save their work. For that I would need to learn how to make a database and actually know how to interact with it. Due to my familiarity with Wordpress, I settled for programming it with PHP and MySQL in the backend. After months of scouring documentation I finished the project, which can be found in <a href="http://www.alfredounapseudobiografia.com" tabindex="0" data-content="Spanish only.">AlfredoUna<wbr>PseudoBiografia.com</a> - [Source][pseudo-source].

After graduation I kept freelancing for some time. During that time I kept learning more JavaScript, breaking out of my jQuery roots. That's when I was contacted by an agency that was looking for a front-end developer. I didn't look twice and leapt for the opportunity.
