I was a teen with somewhat developed art skills and a penchant for computers. During these turbulent and stormy times, I built my first PC from spare parts and installed a pirated* copy of Photoshop 6. I started meddling with digital art and photo manipulation and decided that I could do this during “flexible” work hours as a career. So the logical step was to become a graphic designer. 

Or so I thought.

While studying for my bachelor's degree in Graphic Design I took a class focused on website development. At that time html tables still ruled the land and CSS was just starting to become ubiquitous. However, the professor was a hardcore geek and wanted us to learn everything, from doing math with binary numbers to learning javascript. That class ignited a spark within me. I wanted to code. But for some reason I thought that I wanted to become a software engineer. By that time I didn’t imagine owning the title of  a web developer, and hadn’t even heard the term frontend developer.
