Ah, how do people end up in the jobs they have? There are people who plan their lives from a young age, on straight little railroad tracks without any deviations on that choo-choo train they call life. Others however don’t like trains, and prefer cars that drive through all kinds of curves, twists, and even a u-turn or two. 

I’m in the second group. In a strange way, checking out the different overpasses of life (or you know, you took the wrong path, and had to find that u-turn) has given me some opportunities that I wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. If you would like to roadtrip through my nostalgia,  follow me on A Strange* Path to Becoming a Web Developer: the Story of Alfredo Bermudez.
