title: I build things for the <a tabindex="0" data-content="A web developer in other words.">web*</a>
---
I have over five years of experience working with __Javascript__, __HTML__ and __CSS__. This includes frameworks and libraries like __Bootstrap__, __AngularJS__ and __React__. In the back-end I've worked with __PHP__ and __ASP.NET C#__.  If you want to get an idea of what I'm capable, this page is built with [Jekyll][jekyll], [SASS][sass] and Vanilla ES6 JavaScript with a smidge of [lodash][lodash] and the new [Web Animation API][web-animation], bundled with [Webpack 2][webpack]. The code from this page, and other projects is in my [Github][github]. If you'd like to read more of how I got here, just follow the path.

Ah, how do people end up in the jobs they have? There are people who plan their lives from a young age, on straight little railroad tracks without any deviations on that choo-choo train they call life. Others however don’t like trains, and prefer cars that drive through all kinds of curves, twists, and even offroad.

I’m in the second group. In a strange way, checking out the different overpasses of life (or you know, you took the wrong path, and had to find that u-turn) has given me some opportunities that I wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. If you would like to roadtrip through my nostalgia, follow me on *A <a tabindex="0" data-content="Ok, maybe it's not so strange.">Strange\*</a> Path to Becoming a Web Developer: the Story of Alfredo Bermudez*.
