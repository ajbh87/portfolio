title: This is not the end

For my final project I decided to make an interactive webcomic. In my webcomic, the reader/user would become my co-author. Yet, how to make sure their work wouldnâ€™t be lost and refreshed, to never be seen again? For that I would need to learn how to make a database and actually know how to interact with it. Due to my familiarity with Wordpress, I settled for programming it with PHP and MySQL in the backend.
