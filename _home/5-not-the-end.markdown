title: This Is NOT The End
---
The spark I felt when I first wrote some HTML, has become a forest fire. Front-End development is what I wanted since the beginning. For me part of the fun of all this is how fast this community is growing and changing. I find the slew frameworks and tools that keep popping up exciting. That's why I decided to make this webpage something more than just another "Web Business Card". I want to really become part of the community of Front-End Developers and to start giving back by helping others.

#### Here's the plan

I'll be writing in my [experiments](/blog.html) section about, mostly JavaScript related experiments that I'll be doing for my own learning purposes. I'll explain how I solved the problem and document the tools and research I needed to solve it. Hopefully this helps someone in search of similar answers.
