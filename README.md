#A Strange Path to Becoming a Web Developer
##The Story of Alfredo J. Bermúdez
Several years ago I saw an article by CSS master Chris Coyier in css-tricks.com called [How SVG Line Animation Works](https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/). The article basically showed that by using `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` you could animate the stroke of an SVG path. Fast-forward a few years and I'm brainstorming what to do with my long-pending personal website. Being an art school grad, I started to think about a concept.
