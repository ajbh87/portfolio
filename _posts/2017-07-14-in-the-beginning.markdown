Several years ago I saw an article by CSS master Chris Coyier called [How SVG Line Animation Works](how-svg-line). The article basically explained how you could animate the stroke of an SVG path by altering `stroke-dasharray` and animating `stroke-dashoffset`. I was intrigued by the concept but couldn't really find any practical application at the moment. Fast-forward a few years and I'm brainstorming what to do with my long-pending personal website. Being an art school grad, I started to think about a concept.<!--more-->

{% highlight javascript %}

const m = 'r2d2';

if (m.find(48)) {}
if (NodeList.forEach == null) {

    };
}

{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
